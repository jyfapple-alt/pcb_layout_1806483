"""
BGA Fanout Strategy - Creates escape routing for BGA packages.

The BGA fanout creates:
1. 45-degree stubs from each pad to a routing channel
2. Horizontal or vertical channel segments to exit the BGA boundary
3. Smart layer assignment to avoid collisions on same channel

Key features:
- Generic: works with any BGA package
- Collision-free: tracks on same channel use different layers
- Assumes pads have vias connecting all layers (so any layer can be used)
- Validates no overlapping segments are created
- Differential pair support: P/N pairs routed together on same layer
