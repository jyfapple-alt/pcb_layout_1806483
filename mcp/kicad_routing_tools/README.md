## Features

- **Grid-based A\* pathfinding** with Rust acceleration (~10x faster than Python)
- **Octilinear routing** - Horizontal, vertical, and 45-degree diagonal moves
- **Multi-layer routing** with automatic via insertion
- **Differential pair routing** with pose-based A* and Dubins path heuristic for orientation-aware centerline routing
- **Rip-up and reroute** - When routing fails, automatically rips up blocking routes and retries with progressive N+1 strategy (tries 1 blocker, then 2, up to configurable max). Re-analyzes blocking tracks after each failure for better recovery. Also triggers rip-up when quick probes detect blocking early, before attempting full routes.
- **Ripped route corridor avoidance** - When a net is ripped up, soft penalties are applied to its former corridor. This encourages the current route to avoid that area, increasing the chance the ripped net can be successfully re-routed later.
- **Blocking analysis** - Shows which previously-routed nets are blocking when routes fail
- **Stub layer switching** - Optimization that moves stubs to different layers to avoid vias when source/target are on different layers. Works for both differential pairs and single-ended nets. Finds compatible swap pairs (two nets that can exchange layers to help each other) or moves stubs solo when safe. Tries multiple swap options (source/source, target/target, source/target, target/source) to find valid combinations. Validates that stub endpoints won't be too close to other stubs on the destination layer.
- **Batch routing** with incremental obstacle caching (~7x speedup)
- **Net ordering strategies** - MPS (crossing conflicts with diff pairs treated as units, shorter routes first using BGA-aware distance; uses segment intersection with MST for non-BGA boards), inside-out (BGA), or original order
- **MPS layer swap** - When MPS detects crossing conflicts (nets in Round 2+), attempts layer swaps to eliminate same-layer crossings. Tries swapping both the conflicting Round 2 unit and Round 1 unit. Re-runs MPS after swaps to verify conflict resolution
- **Board edge clearance** - Tracks and vias respect Edge.Cuts boundaries including curved edges (gr_arc), non-rectangular outlines, and interior cutouts. Arcs are automatically linearized into polylines for accurate clearance checking
- **BGA exclusion zones** - Auto-detected from footprints, prevents vias under BGAs
- **Stub proximity avoidance** - Penalizes routes near unrouted stubs, with direction-aware costs (moving away from stubs costs less)
- **BGA proximity avoidance** - Penalizes routes near BGA edges, with direction-aware costs (moving away from BGA zones costs less)
- **Track proximity avoidance** - Penalizes routes near previously routed tracks on the same layer, encouraging spread-out routing
- **Vertical track alignment** - Attracts tracks on different layers to stack vertically (on top of each other), consolidating routing corridors and leaving more room for through-hole vias
- **Adaptive setback angles** - Evaluates 9 setback angles (0°, ±max/4, ±max/2, ±3max/4, ±max) and selects the one that maximizes separation from neighboring stub endpoints, improving routing success when stubs are tightly spaced. Uses 0° when clearance to the nearest stub is sufficient (≥2× spacing), only angling away when stubs are too close
- **U-turn prevention** - Prevents differential pair routes from making U-turns (>180° cumulative turn)
- **GND via placement** - Automatically places GND vias adjacent to differential pair signal vias for return current paths. The Rust router checks clearance and determines optimal placement (ahead or behind signal vias)
- **Automatic polarity swap** - Detects when differential pair P/N polarity differs between source and target pads and automatically swaps target pad net assignments to match. Use `--no-fix-polarity` to disable
- **Target swap optimization** - For swappable nets (e.g., memory lanes), uses Hungarian algorithm to find optimal source-to-target assignments that minimize crossings. Works for both differential pairs and single-ended nets
- **Schematic synchronization** - When `--schematic-dir` is specified, updates KiCad schematic files with any pad swaps (target swaps or polarity swaps) to keep schematics in sync with PCB. Handles multi-unit symbols correctly by updating all schematic files containing the lib_symbol. Disabled by default
- **Chip boundary crossing detection** - Uses chip boundary "unrolling" to accurately detect route crossings for MPS ordering and target swap optimization
- **Turn cost penalty** - Penalizes direction changes during routing to encourage straighter paths with fewer wiggles
- **Bus routing** - Automatically detects groups of nets with clustered endpoints (buses) and routes them together. Uses direction-based attraction so each net follows its neighbor's path in parallel, creating clean parallel traces. Routes from the middle of the bus outward, alternating sides. Enable with `--bus` flag. Configurable detection radius, attraction radius, and attraction bonus
- **Length matching** - Adds trombone-style meanders to match route lengths within groups (e.g., DDR4 byte lanes). Auto-groups DQ/DQS nets by byte lane. Per-bump clearance checking with automatic amplitude reduction to avoid conflicts with other traces. Supports multi-layer routes with vias. Calculates via barrel length from board stackup for accurate length matching that matches KiCad's measurements. Includes stub via barrel lengths (BGA pad vias) using actual stub-layer-to-pad-layer distance
- **Time matching** - Alternative to length matching that matches propagation delay instead of physical length. Accounts for different signal speeds on outer layers (microstrip, faster) vs inner layers (stripline, slower) using effective dielectric constants from the board stackup. Use `--time-matching` to enable. Tolerance specified in picoseconds
- **Multi-point routing** - Routes nets with 3+ pads using an MST-based 3-phase approach: (1) compute MST between all pads and route the longest edge, (2) apply length matching, (3) route remaining MST edges in length order (longest first). This ensures length-matched routes are clean 2-point paths while connecting all pads optimally
- **Impedance-controlled routing** - Specify target impedance (e.g., 50Ω single-ended, 100Ω differential) and track widths are automatically calculated per layer from the board stackup. Uses IPC-2141 formulas for microstrip (outer layers) and stripline (inner layers). Widths adjust automatically when switching layers via vias to maintain target impedance
- **Power net routing** - Route power nets (GND, VCC, etc.) with wider tracks than signal nets. Specify patterns and corresponding widths (e.g., `--power-nets "*GND*" "*VCC*" --power-nets-widths 0.4 0.5`). First matching pattern determines width for each net. Obstacle clearances automatically adjust for wider power traces. Power net widths are never smaller than the base track width
- **Net class support** - The KiCad plugin reads net class parameters (track width, via size, clearance) from the board and uses them automatically. Nets can be organized by net class in separate tabs for easier selection. When routing nets from different classes, obstacle clearances properly account for the larger clearance requirements (e.g., routing "Wide" class nets with 0.4mm clearance near "Default" class pads)
- **AI-powered power net analysis** - Use the `/analyze-power-nets` skill to identify power nets and recommend track widths. The skill uses WebSearch to look up component datasheets, classifies components by their role (power source, current sink, pass-through, shunt), traces current paths, and generates ready-to-use `--power-nets` configurations. See [Power Net Analysis](docs/power-nets.md) for details
- **Power/ground plane via connections** - Automatically places vias to connect SMD pads to inner-layer copper planes. Supports multiple nets in one run (e.g., GND and VCC planes). Smart via placement tries pad center first, then spirals outward with A* routing to pads. Optional blocker rip-up removes interfering nets to maximize via placement, with automatic re-routing of ripped nets
- **Multi-net plane layers** - Multiple power nets can share a single copper layer using Voronoi partitioning. Each net's vias get their own non-overlapping zone polygon. MST-based routing connects all vias of each net, with routes sampled as additional Voronoi seeds to ensure connected zones. Retries with net reordering when edges fail to route. Displays plane resistance and max current capacity (IPC-2152) for each polygon
- **Disconnected plane region repair** - After power planes are created, regions may be effectively split due to vias and traces from other nets cutting through the plane. The `route_disconnected_planes.py` script detects disconnected regions and routes wide, short tracks between them to ensure electrical continuity
- **GND return via placement** - Automatically places GND vias near signal vias for return current paths. Searches from minimum viable distance outward (24 angles, fine step), placing GND vias as close as possible while respecting track clearances. Through-hole GND pads count as existing return paths. Use `--add-gnd-vias` with route_planes.py
- **AI-powered high-speed net analysis** - Use the `/find-high-speed-nets` skill to identify which nets carry high-speed signals. Looks up component datasheets via WebSearch to find max interface frequencies and rise times, traces signals through series passives, and recommends `--gnd-via-distance` values based on the fastest signals on the board. See the [GND return via distance guidance](#gnd-return-via-distance-guidance) in the planes documentation

## Command-Line Interface

### Net Pattern Syntax

All `--nets` options support fnmatch-style wildcards and exclusion patterns:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `*` | All nets |
| `*DATA*` | Nets containing "DATA" |
| `/*` | Nets starting with "/" (hierarchical) |
| `Net-(U1-*)` | Nets matching "Net-(U1-...)" |
| `!GND` | Exclude net named "GND" |
| `!*VCC*` | Exclude nets containing "VCC" |
| `"*" "!GND" "!VCC"` | All nets except GND and VCC |

**Notes:**
- Exclusion patterns (starting with `!`) remove matching nets from the result
- Order matters: include patterns add nets, exclude patterns remove them
- Nets starting with "unconnected-" are automatically excluded
- Use quotes around patterns with special characters

### Route Nets

```bash
# Route all nets (default) - outputs to input_routed.kicad_pcb
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb

# Route all nets, overwrite input file
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --overwrite

# Route all nets to a specific output file
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Route specific nets (using --nets option)
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-DATA_0)" "Net-(U2A-DATA_1)"

# Route with wildcard patterns
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-DATA_*)"

# Route all nets on a component (auto-excludes GND/VCC/VDD/unconnected)
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --component U1

# Route specific patterns on a component (no auto-exclusion)
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "/DDAT*" --component U1

# Route ALL nets on a component including power (use "*" pattern)
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*" --component U1

# Route all nets except GND and VCC (exclusion patterns with ! prefix)
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*" "!GND" "!VCC"

# Route differential pairs (use route_diff.py)
python route_diff.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*lvds*" --no-bga-zones

# Route with wider tracks for power nets
python route.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net*" \
  --power-nets "*GND*" "*VCC*" "+3.3V" --power-nets-widths 0.4 0.5 0.3 --track-width 0.2

# Typical workflow: create GND plane first, then route all signals
python route_planes.py kicad_files/flat_hierarchy.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu
python route.py kicad_files/flat_hierarchy_routed.kicad_pcb --overwrite
```

### 3. Create Power/Ground Planes

```bash
# Create GND zone on B.Cu with via connections to all GND pads (outputs to input_routed.kicad_pcb)
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Create GND zone, overwrite input file
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --overwrite --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Create GND zone to specific output file
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Create multiple planes at once (each net paired with corresponding plane layer)
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND +3.3V --plane-layers In1.Cu In2.Cu

# Create VCC plane with larger vias
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets VCC --plane-layers In2.Cu --via-size 0.5 --via-drill 0.4

# Rip up blocking nets and automatically re-route them
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND +3.3V --plane-layers In1.Cu In2.Cu --rip-blocker-nets --reroute-ripped-nets

# Multiple nets sharing same layer via Voronoi partitioning (use | separator)
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND "VA19|VA11" --plane-layers In4.Cu In5.Cu

# Dry run to see what would be placed
python route_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu --dry-run
```

### 3b. Repair Disconnected Plane Regions

After creating power planes, regions may become split by vias and traces from other nets. Use `route_disconnected_planes.py` to reconnect them:

```bash
# Auto-detect all zones in PCB and repair disconnected regions (outputs to input_routed.kicad_pcb)
python route_disconnected_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb

# Auto-detect all zones, overwrite input
python route_disconnected_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --overwrite

# Auto-detect all zones to specific output file
python route_disconnected_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Specific nets and layers
python route_disconnected_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb --nets GND --plane-layers B.Cu

# Customize track width and clearance
python route_disconnected_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb \
    --track-width 0.5 --clearance 0.2
```

### 4. Verify Results

```bash
# Check for DRC violations (default clearance: 0.2mm)
python check_drc.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Check connectivity (detects unrouted nets, broken routes, and T-junctions)
python check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb

# Check connectivity for specific nets
python check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --nets "*DATA*"

# Check connectivity for all nets on a component
python check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --component U1

# Only check routed nets (skip unrouted net detection)
python check_connected.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb --routed-only

# Check for orphan stubs (traces ending without proper connection)
python check_orphan_stubs.py kicad_files/output.kicad_pcb
```

### 5. Power Net Analysis

Use the `/analyze-power-nets` skill to identify power nets and get track width recommendations:

```
# Ask Claude to analyze your board with datasheet lookup
/analyze-power-nets kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb
```

The skill:
1. Auto-classifies obvious components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.)
2. Uses WebSearch to look up datasheets for unknown components (ICs, connectors, transistors)
3. Classifies each component's role (power source, current sink, pass-through, shunt)
4. Traces power paths from sinks to sources
5. Generates ready-to-use `--power-nets` configurations

See [Power Net Analysis](docs/power-nets.md) for detailed documentation.

### 6. High-Speed Net Analysis

Use the `/find-high-speed-nets` skill to identify high-speed nets and get GND return via recommendations:

```
# Ask Claude to analyze signal speeds with datasheet lookup
/find-high-speed-nets kicad_files/my_board.kicad_pcb
```

The skill:
1. Pre-classifies nets by name patterns (DDR, USB, SPI, CLK, etc.)
2. Pre-classifies components by footprint (FPGA, DDR, PHY, etc.)
3. Uses WebSearch to look up datasheets for ICs and extract max clock rates and rise times
4. Traces high-speed signals through series passives (termination resistors, AC coupling caps)
5. Generates a speed classification (ultra-high/high/medium/low) with recommended `--gnd-via-distance`

The `/plan-pcb-routing` skill includes a lightweight version of this analysis (net name and
footprint pattern matching only, no datasheet lookup) and automatically includes a GND return
via step when GND planes are present. Run `/find-high-speed-nets` first for more accurate
recommendations based on actual component specifications.

### 7. Integration Tests

```bash
# Run full integration test (fanout + routing + checks)
python tests/test_fanout_and_route.py --all

# Quick mode for faster testing
python tests/test_fanout_and_route.py --all --quick
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed documentation of all test scripts.

```

Features:
- **Multi-net support** - Process multiple nets in one run (e.g., GND and VCC planes)
- **Voronoi partitioning** - Multiple nets can share a single plane layer using `|` separator (e.g., `"VA19|VA11"`). Each net's vias get non-overlapping zone polygons. MST edges are routed between all vias using A* pathfinding, with routes sampled as Voronoi seeds to ensure connected zones. Retries with failed nets first (up to 5 iterations)
- **Automatic pad classification** - Identifies SMD pads needing vias vs through-hole/zone-layer pads
- **Smart via placement** - Places vias at pad center when possible, spirals outward when blocked
- **A\* trace routing** - Routes traces from offset vias to pads, avoiding all copper layers
- **Via reuse with fallback** - Prefers nearby vias within reuse radius, falls back to farther vias if placement fails
- **Blocker rip-up** - When via placement/routing fails, identifies blocking nets and temporarily removes them, then retries
- **Automatic re-routing** - Optionally re-routes ripped nets after all plane vias are placed
- **Zone creation** - Creates copper pour zone. If an existing zone for the same net/layer is present, it is replaced with new parameters (clearance, min_thickness)
- **Resistance analysis** - Calculates and displays approximate plane resistance and maximum current capacity (IPC-2152) for each polygon. For multi-net layers, uses the longest MST route path length; for single-net layers, uses the bounding box diagonal. Samples polygon width perpendicular to the current path to estimate effective cross-section. Assumes 1 oz copper and 10°C temperature rise

See [Power/Ground Planes](docs/route-plane.md) for detailed documentation.

### Disconnected Plane Region Repair (route_disconnected_planes.py)

After creating power planes, regions may become split by vias and traces from other nets cutting through. This script detects disconnected regions within each plane zone and routes wide, short tracks between them.

```bash
python route_disconnected_planes.py kicad_files/input.kicad_pcb [output.kicad_pcb] [OPTIONS]

# Output options (default: input_routed.kicad_pcb)
--overwrite, -O         # Overwrite input file instead of creating _routed copy

# Zone selection (auto-detects all zones if not specified)
--nets, -n GND +3.3V        # Net name(s) to process
--plane-layers, -p B.Cu In1.Cu  # Plane layer(s) to process
--layers, -l F.Cu In1.Cu In2.Cu B.Cu  # Layers available for routing (default: all copper)

# Track width
--max-track-width 2.0       # Maximum track width for connections (mm)
--min-track-width 0.2       # Minimum track width for connections (mm)
--track-width 0.3           # Default track width for routing config (mm)

# Clearance
--clearance 0.25            # Trace-to-trace clearance (mm)
--zone-clearance 0.2        # Zone fill clearance around obstacles (mm)
--track-via-clearance 0.8   # Clearance from tracks to other nets' vias (mm)
--board-edge-clearance 0.5  # Clearance from board edge (mm)
--hole-to-hole-clearance 0.3  # Minimum clearance between drill holes (mm)

# Via options
--via-size 0.5              # Via outer diameter (mm)
--via-drill 0.3             # Via drill diameter (mm)

# Grid
--grid-step 0.1             # Routing grid step (mm)
--analysis-grid-step 0.5    # Grid step for connectivity analysis (coarser = faster)

# Routing
--max-iterations 200000     # Maximum A* iterations per route attempt

# Debug
--dry-run                   # Analyze without writing output
--verbose, -v               # Print detailed debug messages
--debug-lines               # Add debug lines on User.4 layer showing route paths
```

Features:
- **Auto-detection** - Automatically finds all zones in PCB if nets/layers not specified
- **Per-net processing** - Zones with the same net on multiple layers are processed together, reducing redundant routes since vias connect all layers
- **Flood-fill region detection** - Uses grid-based flood fill to identify disconnected regions across all zone layers
- **Cross-layer connectivity** - Uses vias and through-hole pads to properly track connectivity across multiple zone layers
- **MST-based connections** - Connects regions using minimum spanning tree for optimal routing
- **Multi-point routing** - Uses ALL anchors (vias/pads) in each region as potential connection points, trying both directions (A->B and B->A) since A* can find different paths depending on direction
- **Wide track routing** - Tries track widths from max (2.0mm) down to min (0.2mm), using the widest width that fits without rebuilding obstacle maps
- **Smart via placement** - Only adds new vias at layer transitions if no via already exists at that position
- **Hole-to-hole clearance** - Respects drill hole clearances when placing new vias
- **Multi-layer routing** - Can route through any copper layer to connect regions

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- numpy (`pip3 install numpy`)
- scipy (`pip3 install scipy`) - used for optimal target assignment and Voronoi partitioning
- shapely (`pip3 install shapely`) - used for polygon union in multi-net plane layers
- Rust toolchain (for building the router module)
- pygame-ce (optional, for visualizer: `pip3 install pygame-ce`)

## Limitations

- No push-and-shove (routes around obstacles, doesn't move them)
- No layer swaps of stubs for multipoint nets (3+ pads)
- No blind or buried vias
- No user-defined keepout zones
- No coarse grid assignment before detailed routing to plan overall topology
- No via cost or other parameter learning/tuning
- No design rules by region/area support
