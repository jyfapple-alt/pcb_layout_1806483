"""
Shared base utilities for PCB routing.

This module contains the core position and geometry utilities used by all routing modules.
The bulk of routing functionality has been split into:
- connectivity.py: Endpoint finding, stub analysis, MST algorithms
- net_queries.py: Pad/net queries, MPS ordering, route length calculations
- pcb_modification.py: Add/remove routes, segment cleanup
